Hardware options (Page 3):
nofirewire      This disables the loading of Firewire modules.  This should
                only be necessary if your Firewire hardware is causing
                a problem with booting the CD.
nogpm           This diables gpm console mouse support.
nohotplug       This disables the loading of the hotplug and coldplug init
                scripts at boot.  This is useful for doing debugging of a
                failing CD or driver.

                keyboard layouts.

nosmp           This disables SMP, or Symmetric Multiprocessing, on SMP-enabled
                kernels.  This is useful for debugging SMP-related issues with
                certain drivers and motherboards.

                for systems where sound support causes problems.
nousb           This disables the autoloading of USB modules.  This is useful
                for debugging USB issues.
